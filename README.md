# 👋 Hi, I'm Phantira

I’m a **software engineer** who enjoys connecting the dots between technology, data, and real-world problems to create scalable solutions.

My background spans **web development, embedded systems, machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and automation**. I work across the full lifecycle, from understanding problems and designing systems to building applications and delivering solutions that teams can actually use.

Currently working in the UK, I focus on developing data-driven and AI-powered systems that support decision-making, automation, and operational efficiency. Recently, I’ve been focusing more on data and analytics using Python, SQL, and visualization tools to turn messy operational data into clear business insights, decisions, and strategies.


## ✨ About Me

💼 **Role**: Software Engineer | AI Engineer | Full-stack Developer

🧠 **Focus**: AI Applications, Data-driven Systems, Automation, Scalable Software

🌏 **Perspective**: Engineering + product thinking + business understanding

| Project Link | Project Description | Link |
|---|---|---|
| Checkout Feature Impact Analysis & Bundle Strategy | Analyzed the business impact of a checkout feature launch using SQL and Python. Built before/after performance analysis across revenue, AOV, basket size, and category mix. Identified a structural shift toward larger baskets driving +34% revenue growth. Conducted bundle and basket analysis and built a what-if business model incorporating adoption and cannibalization to design a profitable bundle strategy. | [Slide deck](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG-3MvXR1c/1p5x9k0hl558gsZufU_eIg/edit),<br>[Sort Code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/phantirasea/ding-tai),<br>[Medium](https://medium.com/@pkusolruangchai/case-study-increasing-revenue-via-checkout-optimization-at-ding-tai-fung-59a17ca5c8e7) |
| E-commerce Funnel & Customer Decision Analysis | Conducted exploratory data analysis on 5 months (Oct 2019 – Feb 2020) of event-level e-commerce data from a medium-sized cosmetics online store. Built session-based and nested funnel models to identify conversion bottlenecks, revealing that the main friction occurs at the cart-to-purchase stage. Segmented customers by decision speed (Immediate vs Delayed) and analyzed revenue, timing patterns, and product performance to uncover behavioral differences. Delivered data-driven recommendations on checkout optimization, retargeting strategy, and product positioning to improve both conversion rate and revenue growth. | [Medium](https://medium.com/@pkusolruangchai/understanding-customers-by-how-fast-they-decide-to-buy-immediate-vs-delayed-530a1247f328),<br>[Sort Code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/phantirasea/e-commerce-funnel-customer-decision-analysis)|
| Power BI Sales Report Dashboard | Built an interactive Power BI Sales Report by combining invoice and customer master data. Used Power Query for cleaning and modeling, built DAX measures for YoY/YTD and KPI metrics, and designed an interactive report with slicers, maps, trend lines, and Top-N customers to surface actionable sales insights.  | [Medium](https://medium.com/@pkusolruangchai/my-first-power-bi-dashboard-turning-big-excel-files-into-a-clear-sales-report-8ddfe896ea48),<br>[Dashboard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NqgxiE6HS8HZB39RN0crHBjtLBYnU5Y6/view)|
